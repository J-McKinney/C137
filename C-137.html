        Normally, both your asses would be dead as 
        fucking fried chicken, but you happen to 
        pull this shit while I'm in a transitional 
        period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna 
        help you. But I can't give you this case, 
        it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already 
        been through too much shit this morning over 
        this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

        Mister gay is bleeding! Mister gay! Never once touched my per diem. 
        I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soupâ€¦baby, 
        I got a stew goin'. I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, 
        ya freak bitch! But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had 
        to have the crotch taken in a little bit. Actually, that was a box of 
        Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. 
        Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip 
        Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an 
        item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained 
        everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble.
